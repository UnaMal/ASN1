## ASN1 - DATE CONVERSION PROGRAM
This program translates a date from form *mm/dd/yyyy* to the form: *Month dd, yyyy*. 
The program prompts the user for a date of form mm/dd/yyyy, and creates and displays the second form. 
For example, if the user enters 02/11/2020, the program constructs and displays the string: 
February 11, 2020
**Note: Pay attention to the input format!**
